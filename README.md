# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📋 Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System** is designed to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. The system utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze large datasets from popular streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hotstar, enhancing the user experience through accurate and relevant recommendations.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on content similarity.
- **IMDB Ratings Integration:** Displays IMDB ratings for suggested movies to aid user decisions.
- **Interactive GUI:** Built with Tkinter for a user-friendly interface.
- **Web Scraping for Enhanced Data:** Movie posters and ratings are scraped from the IMDB website using BeautifulSoup for real-time, updated information.

## 🗂️ Datasets

- **Source:** Kaggle datasets covering movies from Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hotstar.
- **Attributes:** Includes movie titles, genres, ratings, descriptions, and more.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

- **Jupyter Notebook:** For data analysis and model development.
- **Tkinter:** To create the graphical user interface.
- **Python Libraries:**
  - **Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning models (CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer, Cosine Similarity).
  - **Plotly:** Data visualization.
  - **BeautifulSoup:** Web scraping posters and ratings from IMDB.

## 📊 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and organizing movie data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns and trends in the data.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into numerical vectors.
4. **Similarity Calculation:** Applying Cosine Similarity to measure content similarity between movies.
5. **Recommendation Engine:** Suggesting movies based on similarity scores.
6. **Web Scraping:** Extracting movie posters and updated ratings from IMDB using BeautifulSoup.
7. **GUI Development:** Implementing an intuitive interface with Tkinter for easy user interaction.

## 🔍 Evaluation

- Tested across datasets from Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hotstar.
- Validated recommendations with IMDB ratings for enhanced credibility.

## 📈 Future Scope

- **Hybrid Recommendation System:** Combining content-based and collaborative filtering.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Incorporating live data from streaming platforms.
- **User Feedback Integration:** Refining recommendations based on user ratings.
